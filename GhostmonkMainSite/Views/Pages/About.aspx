    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    
    <img src="../../Content/Images/bank/nicholas.gif" alt="me" />
    <p>For the last seven years plus I have been developing a mix of important abilities in communications, from web programming & design to photography and writing. 
    As an expressive and driven person I find this realm of work best fits my personality, and I am constantly on the move, aiming for that sweet spot of having something to say, and being able to make it memorable (maybe even look good).</p>
    <p>I was pretty much born and raised all across Canada. I mean, I was born in the far east, at the Northern tip of Cape Breton Island where my father learned to become a carpenter in the mid 70's. Now I live in the vibrant Canadian MEGA-City of Toronto, but not before traipsing back and forth across this country, from Halifax to Vancouver, about eight times or so. I've pretty much lost count.</p>
    <p>Family tree wise, I am a descendant of a long line of Acadians on my father's side, who have for generations been living on or near the island called Ile Madame, which is located just off the South-East coast of Cape Breton. To this day I am distantly related to about 400 people in that area. It's not that creepy really, you probably have a 20th-removed cousin somewhere in the world too… I just know where many of mine live. My mother's side is another strange mix of first generation Irish settlers who made their way into the heart of this country, Ontario, generations ago. Additionally, I have some traces of German and English blood coursing through my veins.</p>
    <p>Spending a good portion of my life soaking up the enormity of Canada, I have made prolonged pit stops in Barrie Ontario, Fort McMurray Alberta, Calgary Alberta, Banff Alberta, Halifax Nova Scotia, Port Hawkesbury Nova Scotia, Montreal Quebec, Toronto and now Montreal Again. I live here with my beautiful girlfriend Tracey and my amazing 4-year-old son Lucas-Ray, 1-year-old Logan-John and … Oh, I should also mention that we have three cats: Toro, Urban and Frankie, and a hundred pound Rottweiler/Shepherd cross named Teddy. He's a German monstrosity… but I love him just the same.</p>

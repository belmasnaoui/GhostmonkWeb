'<p>Project statgnation can be as common as rust to a creative worker embarking on a personal project. Professional projects can often take on a fervorous pitch that is hard to duplicate when you are your own client. Unfortunately I was experiencing this malaise.</p>
<p>Lack of ASP.NET knowledge, ambitious goals and the reality of a part-time commitment is making progress on Ghostmonk simlar to that of oceans forming carverns into the side of the cliff.</p>
<p>However, the journey has always been the main goal, and like the sea I try to be relentless.</p>
<p>Certainly the most frustrating experience when working with alien technologies/languages are the so called "Unkown-Unknowns". It can be a disheartening experience indeed, when you think something should work, but are stuck in an endless cycle of fixes and errors. Disoriented, confused and completely abandoning the original task, minutes turn into errors, and results often feel out of reach.</p>
<p>It''s at these moments I pine for the familiar waters of Apache, PHP and MySQL.</p>
<p>It is persistance howeverm, that pays off. Not the sort of persistance that finds you hitting your keys at Two AM in the morning, but the kind that forces you to pick yourself up, and tackle the same task that stymied you the day before.</p>
<p>At one point, trawling the internet for information about the proper use and performance penalties of the runat="server" attribute, I found a comment thread. Instead of answering this question, the participants took to ranting and complaining about Microsoft technologies in general and how ASP and IIS are architecturally broken and just bad bad bad...</p>
<p>At this point, it was clear to me why they complained so. They were experiencing a congnition rebellion, brought on by a cycle of failed expectations. These moments happen, and they can be overwhelming. The wrong response is to rail against the wind, throw punches into the ether and to abandon all hope.</p>
<p>The correct choice is to find your centre, review your problem and refocus your attention.</p>
<p>While reading that impoverished comment thread, Edward Dijksta''s paper "The Humble Programmer", came to mind. Programs and programming are hard. There is no one way around it, and no perfect solutions in building programs. Armed with this fact, a humbled approach to learning and building with a technology can mark the difference between understanding the point, or completely blowing your brains out.</p>
<p>Typically, it''s not technologies that are the problem, but the attitudes of the programmers who use them.</p>
<p>And so, by centering myself, I was able to forge ahead and achieve a large conceptual breakthrough in building Ghostmonk. Now I have Master Pages, have implemented Themes and Skins and have started building custom user controls. Much of these concepts where unknown to me even yesterday.</p>',

'<p>Ok, this site is nowhere near completition, but I''ve made a fair bit of progress on the design. Unfortunately, that was the easy part....</p>
<p>What you are experiencing here is the embryonic stage of a much larger genesis.</p>
<p>No matter how much I study, practice and train, buidling a website from scratch is a serious endeavour. To stem this fact, I am iteratively releasing every aspect of this creation.</p>
<p>It starts with the graphic design.</p>
<p>I don''t actually expect to ever finish, but if I don''t start releasing this thing now, and start releasing often, I will never have anything to show.</p>
<p>The site you see here is about 20 percent of what I have already built, and roughly about 1 percent of what I have floating around in my mind.</p>
<p>There is no monetary model associated to this, only the pure love of programming and technology.</p>
<p>It may take a long long time to achieve something closer to what I have envisioned, but it''s not really about the destination.</p>
<p>If you are rocking Adobe Flash on your Box, then you can take a look at some of my older work here -><a href="http://selectedWork.ghostmonk.com">selectedWork.ghostmonk.com</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the interest!</p>',
